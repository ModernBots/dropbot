## Instructions

Type `/`, and navigate to ModernBot to see all the commands.

I have 2 main functions: polls and role menus.

Type `/`, and navigate to ModernBot to see all the commands.

Use `/poll` to make a poll.
Options should be seperated by commas, and a poll can have up to 25 options.
The poll author can use `/close_poll` to close a poll they made.

For role menus and role buttons, you must have the **Manage Roles** permission in order to run the commands.

Use `/role_menu` to make a role menu.
You have to choose one role when making a role menu, and can add more roles to a role menu by using `/add_role_to_menu`.
Likewise, you can use `/remove_role_from_menu` to remove a role from a menu.

Use `/role_button` to make a role button.
Reccomended for single role assign functions/rule agreement.
Only one button/role per message.
